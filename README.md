Overview of the Project
Project:Temperature and Humidity monitoring with DHT Sensor

Objective: The project aims to develop a simple and efficient system to monitor and record temperature and humidity levels in real-time using a DHT sensor. This can be used for environmental monitoring, home automation, or agricultural applications.

Key Activities 
Sensor Data Collection: Use the DHT11/DHT22 sensor to measure temperature and humidity. Data Processing: Capture raw data from the sensor and convert it into meaningful temperature (°C/°F) and humidity (%) values. Display and Logging: Display readings on an LCD screen or console. Optionally, log the data to a local file or a cloud platform for historical analysis.

Technologies Used Hardware: DHT11/DHT22 Sensor Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP32, etc.) Optional: LCD Display/LEDs Software: TINKERCAD
